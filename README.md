- 👋 Hi, I am Stefan La Terra
- 👀 I’m interested in all things cyber and sys engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning towards my AZ-104 and CEH certifications
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with entry level developers to help grow my programming capabilities beyond my current entry level skill-set that requires a lot of work.
- 📫 Feel free to reach me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefan-la-terra-1b893692/
